Two days ago, I gave a talk about <a href="http://codeigniter.com" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a>, a popular light-weight PHP web application framework. The slides are available <a href="http://kaiwangchen.github.io/presentations/understand-CodeIgniter.html" title="Understand CodeIgniter" target="_blank">here</a>. I am sorry to say they do not fit into a cellphone screen, so one'd better view in a desktop browser. I was trying to make better understanding about the contract between framework developers and application developers by covering a lot of caveats. They are at hard-core level, so might be a little overwhelming for fresh hands. Finally, I'd like to share my experience of exploring a web application framework: it is all about *request routing* and *class loading*. 

Enjoy.
