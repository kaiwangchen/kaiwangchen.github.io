Last week I gave a talk about the Java Virtual Machine, and slides are available [here][1]. 

I was trying to cover the connections between real machine and virtual machine, and how high-level programming concepts are mapped to real/virtual machine inputs, and finally virtual machine operation skills. 

Enjoy.
